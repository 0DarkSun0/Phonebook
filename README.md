# Phonebook
C program that keeps a database of people's names, their birthdates, and their phone numbers. The program uses the CSV file phonebook.csv as a database. People's names, birthdates, and phone numbers can be added to the database. The size of the phonebook is chosen by the user and the memory for it is dynamically allocated into a linked list. The program source filenames are mini5main.c, mini5phone.c, and mini5phone.h. mini5main.c contains the main function of the program, as well as the menu function used for the execution of the program. mini5phone.c contains the functions loadCSV, saveCSV, addRecord, findRecord, listRecords, delete, and clear, which are used in mini5main.c. mini5phone.h is a header file containing the structure used to store and buffer the records, external global variables, and function prototypes. A makefile is used to compile the program. This project involves linked lists, modular programming, git, dynamic memory, structures, and working with text files. The program was created by Kevin Luo, Siger Ma, and Stefan Wallin (myself) on April 13th, 2023.
